Provides classes for the Sigma knowledge engineering environment version developed
at Articulate Software Inc.  The core class is KB.java which handles data structures
and operations on a knowledge base, including importing the individual KIF files
which comprise a knowledge base.  KBmanager is class which has a static variable that
contains what should be the only instance of KBmanager.  KBmanager may contain several
KBs.  KIF reads KIF files into a KB object.  NLformatter handles generation of natural
language paraphrases from logic.  Vampire handles the interface to the Vampire theorem
prover.  The original version of this code is intended to be used with a set of jsp
pages but later versions are planned that support both web/jsp interface and a stand-
alone interface.<P>
