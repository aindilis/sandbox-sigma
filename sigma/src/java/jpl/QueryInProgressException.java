// QueryInProgressException
/**
 * An exception of this type is thrown if a Query is made while 
 * another Query is in progress, for example, if the JPL programmer
 * has negglected to close a query by exhausting all solutions or by failing
 * to rweind() a Query, or in multi-threaded situations.
 * <p>
 * To prevent this kind of exception from being thrown, first make 
 * absolutely sure that all Queries are being closed properly, either
 * by exhausting all solutions in a Query (i.e., hasMoreSolutions()
 * returns false), or by explicitly calling rewind().  If your program
 * involves multi-threading, make sure you obtain the lock from the
 * Query object before entering a hasMoreSolutions()/nextSolution loop:
 * <pre>
 * Query query = // get a query somehow
 * synchronized ( jpl.Query.lock() ){
 *     while ( query.hasMoreElements() ){
 *          Hashtable solution = query.nextSolution();
 *          // process solution...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <b>Note:</b>  In most situations such care is not necessary, since
 * the Query.query(), Query,oneSolution(), and Query.allSolutions()
 * methods are thread-safe.  However, users may have reason
 * to use the hasMoreSolutions() and nextSolutions() methods, which,
 * while synchronized, do allow Queries to be opened between calls to
 * these methods.
 * <p>
 * If you catch this Exception, you can usese the query() accessor to 
 * obtain a reference to the Query that is in progress.
