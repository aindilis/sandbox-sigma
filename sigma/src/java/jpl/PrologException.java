// PrologException
/**
 * An exception of this type is thrown if, in evaluating a Query,
 * an exception is thrown in Prolog via the Prolog throw/1 predicate.
 * <p>
 * This method provides High-Level interface programmers to handle
 * such exceptions, providing error management between Prolog and Java.
 * <p>
 * Use the exception_term() accessor to obtain the Term that was
 * thrown via the throw/1 Prolog predicate.
