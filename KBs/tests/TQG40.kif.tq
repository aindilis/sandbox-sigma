(answer yes)


;; This test fails because there are no axioms to prevent a
;; BinaryPredicate from being used to form a statement with three
;; arguments.  (Such axioms cause problems of their own.)  This sort
;; of syntactic correctness enforcement probably should not be done in
;; inference, but as part of a canonicalization/rejection step that
;; prevents non-wff expressions from ever reaching the inference
;; engine.
